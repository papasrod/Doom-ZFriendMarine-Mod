-This is an edited version of Sergeant_Mark_IV's "Brutal Friends" Companion Mod that changes the item to be permanently available in your inventory.

-The item will only spawn 1 (marine) actor. Use it again by simply using the "Use" button if the actor is unable to teleport near you or spawn.

-Removed the other actors to make way for a clean and simple format.

-Intended to be played on ZDoom sourceports.
